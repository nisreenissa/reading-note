\* JavaScript is a simple words we can say that JavaScript is made to program the behaviour of the web pages .
how the web browser will understand this , will understand by the interpreter .
The interpreter takes your instructions (in JavaScript) and translates them into instructions the browser can understand to achievethe tasks you want it to perform and you will save it with the extension .js
Html is a way to make the structure for your website and you will save it with extension .html 
CSS is language to specify the layout of web pages and you will save it with the extension .css there is a tag called <script> we will use it to notify the browser to load the javascript file .
If you view the source code of the page in the browser,the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web-page that the browser has created. 
the script is some of instructions that your computer will follow each one of the instructions known as statement ,statements should end with a semicolon .
here is some tips about JavaScript : 
JS is a case sensitive Some statements are surrounded by curly braces;these are known as code blocks. 
The closing curly brace is not followed by a semicolon, but the statements should end with semicolon.you can write comments to give more details about the code to make it easier to read or understand . you can do this by /* put multi line comment here */or for single line comment //var today= new Date(); // this is to create a datevar hour Now = today.getHours(); // this will give me the current hour var greeting; 
The greeting var will use if statement to give the correct time if (hourNow > 18) 
{greeting = 'Good evening ' ;
else if (hourNow > 12) 
{greeting = 'Good afternoon';
else if (hourNow > 0) {greeting= ' Good morning';else {greeting = 'Welcome';}
document.write(greeting) ;
