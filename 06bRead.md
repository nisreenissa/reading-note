# What makes a computer a computer : 

##### 1-input ( tell your computer i what to do by keyboard .Mic,, Mouse ...)
##### 2-Storage ( Memory)
##### 3- Processing (process the input using a series of command to make the output)
##### 4-Output (Text,Photos,Videos..)

###### Inside the computer there is wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computerBit , the computer Bit : The smallest piece of information a computer can store, more bits more information
###### Binary & Data0 or 1, True or False, Yes or No, On or off,Bits can be 1 or 0, wires include bit that can be 1 or 0, with more bits you can present complex information.
###### Decimal number system has 10 digitsIn binary system only 1 or 0 can be usedAny number can be represented in 1 and 0.

###### Texts images and sounds can be represented as 0, 1.
###### Each image made of pixels, each pixel has colour each colour represented in number.

##### Every sound made of a series of vibrationVibrations can represented graphically as waveEach wave form represented in numberSound More bit has more qualityCircuits and logicEvery input and output through computer are a type of informationCan be represented in on or off signal or o,1 1 Circuit can modify and combine inputs to provide outputExample of circuit 0 and 1 = 01 and 1 = 1 If its “and” logical relation to have 1 as output both input should be 1.Adder used to combine bitsThe smallest is the circuit the distance less the computer is fasterCPU, memory, Input & outputAll computer do the same thing:Input -> store -> process -> output 
##### information Input device: input ex: mouseMemory: storeCPU: processOutput device: output ex: screenSW & HDCPU control parts of computerCPU receive command to know what circuit to use and when to useNo body write SW in binary, Programming languages let u type commands in a way look like English,OS is a program manage how SW gets to use the HW, control other SW,OS is switching between Programs in seconds so programs no run at the same time.
