Markdown (customization)will allow you to create a a syntax to style your text, add an image , create a list and you will control displaying your format in such an easy and faster way using the GitHub platform .

You can use Markdown in 3 places around GitHub:

The first place is Gists
The second one is Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
The third one is Files with the .md or .markdown extension

I will show you how to write some Markdown syntax using Github :
(# )This is an <h1> tag
(##) This is an <h2> tag
(######) This is an <h6> tag
(*) to make the text italic
(_) to make the text also italic
(** ) to make the text bold
(__) to make the text bold
_You **can** combine them_
unorded list will be don by using (*) here is an example for you :
* blue
* Orange
* White
Ordered list

Images
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)
Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then put the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
Example :[GitHub](http://github.com)
Blockquotes (Quoting)
As the blind man said
> I see
Inline code
You should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.


Some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions and comments of Issues and Pull Requests. These include @mentions as well as references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests. Task Lists are also available in Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files.
