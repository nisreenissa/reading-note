# Markdown
###Markdown (customization)will allow you to create a a syntax to style your text, add an image , create a list and you will control displaying your format in such an easy and faster way using the GitHub platform .

You can use Markdown in 3 places around GitHub:

The first place is Gists
The second one is Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
The third one is Files with the .md or .markdown extension

I will show you how to write some Markdown syntax using Github :
(# )This is an <h1> tag
(##) This is an <h2> tag
(######) This is an <h6> tag
(*) to make the text italic
(_) to make the text also italic
(** ) to make the text bold
(__) to make the text bold
_You **can** combine them_
unorded list will be don by using (*) here is an example for you :
* blue
* Orange
* White
Ordered list
1. Blue
1. Orange
1. White
Images
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)
Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then put the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
Example :[GitHub](http://github.com)
Blockquotes (Quoting)
As the blind man said
> I see
Inline code
You should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.


Some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions and comments of Issues and Pull Requests. These include @mentions as well as references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests. Task Lists are also available in Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files.

this is an example for java script using the the syntax highlighting in GetHub
Tables
lets talk about Tables: you will divide the header and the content by (-)
and the columns with a pipe (|)
SHA references
Any reference to a commit’s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted into a link to that commit on GitHub.

Any reference to a commit’s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted into a link to that commit on GitHub.

Username @mentions: its like the Facebook you will enter@ then mention the peson name to no notify him to read your comment
Automatic linking for URLs
Any URL (like http://www.ltuc.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link(click and go)
Strikethrough
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out
Emoji :GitHub will let you enjoy using the emojis by typing :
Paragraphs
You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.
Ignoring Markdown formatting
You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.
Example (the output)
Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.

jackyl in Github : will allow you to transform a text to a website

You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backtick
Example : you can Use git status to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed

Task lists (checkboxes)
To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].
