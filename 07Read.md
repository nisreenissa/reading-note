##### To write a script, you need to first state your goal(what is the problem define it ) and then list the tasks(how can i solve it by coding ) that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
##### The conclusion is you have to put the scenario for solving the problem line by line will make easier to also write the code line by line .
##### how you can write your variable , there is rules you have to follow :
