# Html

\* HTML uses tags (characters that you will put  inside angled bracket sometimes will will call them elemnts ) to give the information they surround special meaning.
most of the tags have opening and closing tags 
Opening tags can carry attributes with name and value , which tell us more about the content of that element

we will talk now about one tag called <img> you can specify the dimension and  write your code with the source (path) for the image 
like this <img src="you will put the source here" width="" height=""/>
what we did here is called CSS which mean styling your image and determine the width and the height is styling , the css will allow to style your page by using diffrent colors for your text or your background ,or you can change font and alot of stylings you will learn by practicing 
.

Our last topic here is forms we all know what is forms or at least heard the word before , the forms is the shape and structure we built to collect information from the vistors , we do this by tag called <form> \*
