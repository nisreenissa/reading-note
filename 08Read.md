##### Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. 
##### 1- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 
##### 2- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 
##### 3- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object such as String, Number, Math, and Date.

##### conditional statment(if , then , else )
##### Example  if (age>18){
##### document.write('you can have a drive license');}
##### else {document.write(''after 18 you can have it');

##### for boolean the result should be is true or false , you will need to know that  (===) is equal to and it will compaire the data type  . also for (!===) not equal to will compare the value and the datetype.(==) will compare only the value (!==) will compare the value only if the condition is not equal the given value 
##### another operators < ,< ,<=,>= 

##### The switch statement executes a block of code depending on different cases, Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 
##### break will end the running 
##### switch (level) {
##### case 'One ':
##### title= 'Level 1 ' ;
##### break;
##### case 'Two':
##### title = ' Level 2 ' ;
##### break;
##### case ' Three' :
##### title = 'Level 3' ;
##### break ;
##### default :
##### title= 'Test';
##### break;}

##### The getElementsByTagName() method returns a collection of an elements's child elements with the specified tag name 

##### The conclusion if the loops checks if it return true a code  will run , if not then the condition is false in switch statment the code will keep runing untill the result is true , [break] wil end running the code
